# RayTracer
This is a basic implementation of a Ray Tracer that has been developed for the course "GFX - Foundations of Computer Graphics" at the University of Vienna. The goal of this assignment was to create an application which is able to render a scene based on a given XML file which follows a specific [file specification](http://vda.univie.ac.at/Teaching/Graphics/21s/Labs/Lab2/lab2_file_specification.html). The development of an OBJ parser was also essential for rendering the individual shapes included in the scenes.
